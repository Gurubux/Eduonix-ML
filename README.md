Project 1 - Breast Cancer Detection - In this project, you will use the K-nearest neighbor algorithm to help detect breast cancer malignancies by using a support vector machine.<br>

Project 2 - Board Game Review - You will learn how to perform a linear regression analysis by predicting the average reviews on a board game in this project.<br><br>

<h4>2. Classification</h4>
Project 3 - Markov Models and K-Nearest Neighbor Approaches to Classifying DNA Sequences - In this project, you will learn about bioinformatics by using Markov models and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithms to classify E. Coli DNA sequences.<br><br>

<h4>3. Clustering</h4>
Project 4 - Stock Market Clustering Project - In this project, you will use a K-means clustering algorithm to identify related companies by finding correlations among stock market movements over a given time span.<br>

Project 5 - K-Means Clustering For Image Analysis - In this project, you will learn how to use K-Means clustering in an unsupervised learning method to analyze and classify 28 x 28 pixel images from the MNIST dataset.<br><br>

<h4>4. NLP</h4>
Project 6 - Getting Started with Natural Language Processing In Python - This project will cover Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodology, including tokenizing words and sentences, part of speech identification and tagging, and phrase chunking.<br>

Project 7 - Natural Language Processing: Text Classification - This project will take an advance approach to Natural Language Processing by solving a text classification task using multiple classification algorithms, including a Naive Bayes classifier, SGD classifier, and linear support vector classifier (SVC). So, what are you waiting for? Become a machine learning magician with this extensive course!<br><br>

<h4>5. Deep Learning</h4>

Project 8 - Obtaining Near State-of-the-Art Performance on Object Recognition Tasks Using Deep Learning - This project will use the CIFAR-10 object recognition dataset as a benchmark and will implement a recently published deep neural network that can obtain similar results to state-of-the-art networks.<br>

Project 9 - Image Super Resolution with the SRCNN - In this tutorial, we will implement and use a Tensorflow version of the Super Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) to improve the image quality of degraded images.<br>

Project 10 - Diabetes Onset Detection - In this project, you will fine-tune a deep learning neural network by performing a grid search to detect the onset of diabetes based on patient data.<br><br>


<h4>5. Dimensionality Reduction</h4>
Project 11 - Data Compression & Visualization Using Principle Component Analysis - This project will show you how to compress our Iris dataset into a 2D feature set and how to visualize it through a normal x-y plot using k-means clustering.<br><br>

<h4>5. Anomaly Detection</h4>
Project 12 - Credit Card Fraud Detection - In this project, you are going to do a credit card fraud detection and going to focus on anomaly detection by using probability densities.<br>
